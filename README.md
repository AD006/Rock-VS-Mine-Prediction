# Rock-VS-Mine-Prediction using Machine Learning
The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our work is to predict whether it is a Metal or Rock from Sonar return data. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The label associated with each record, R stands for Rock and M for Mine. We use some types of algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM and Decision Tree.
